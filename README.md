# Python for Advanced Web Apps

Read the documention: [Python Beginners](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This repo is being built out in spring 2020. It's based on [an earlier repo](https://github.com/macloo/python-beginners).

In this new repo I'm using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/intro.html) and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) *for the first time* (so that's a journey in itself) to build a text for journalism students learning Python.

We are using [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (second edition) as our textbook and main resource for learning Python from zero. Therefore, this repo does not attempt to teach Python *basics* &mdash; although it does include some basic scripts.

Code for the course is all in the `/python_code_examples` folder.

The main reason for the docs is that the course covers:

1. Introduction to Python
2. Web scraping with Beautiful Soup and some Selenium
3. Flask for building data-driven web apps

In this forked repo, I made a new arrangement for part 2 (and probably part 3 later) during my learning process. Check the notebooks and it should be fresher! Have fun.
